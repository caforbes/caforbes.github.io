As the Technology Coordinator for [FirstVoices](https://www.firstvoices.com/), I wrangled two software projects (web and keyboards), a platform/database redesign, a data migration pipeline, a user consultation project team, the user support desk, and all documentation. I also got to prototype several features to ensure that they worked for 90+ unique language varieties!

As a PhD and postdoctoral researcher, I worked closely with the GitxsanimxÌ± language for 10 years. I worked regularly with elders, collected a lot of data and built a system for processing it, analyzed novel aspects of the language's morphosyntax, and published my work. I looked a lot at problems relating to agreement patterns, ergativity, the internal structure of words, and verb-first sentences. I also did a lot of teaching, mentorship, presenting, and collaboration. I continue to work on community language revitalization initiatives in a support role.
