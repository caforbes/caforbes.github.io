I am an independent researcher in the area of linguistics, language documentation, and language technology, specializing in Indigenous languages and low-resource contexts. My skills and experience include backend web development (Python, Ruby) and technical/educational writing for diverse audiences.

Currently, I work as a technology associate for the BC First Peoples' Cultural Council, to support the use and ongoing development of [FirstVoices](https://www.firstvoices.com/) (a language platform and archive for BC Indigenous communities).

My linguistic research is in formal morphosyntax and field linguistic research on Indigenous languages of the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia, specializing in Gitksan (GitxsanimxÌ±) and the Tsimshianic languages. My syntactic work focuses on agreement, ergativity, and the features & internal structure of noun phrases. I am involved in ongoing development of text corpora (story collections) and grammatical resources for Gitksan, as well as the design of natural language processing workflows for low-resource languages.
