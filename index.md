I am an independent researcher in the area of linguistics and language technology, specializing in Indigenous languages and low-resource contexts. My skills and experience include natural language data analysis, backend engineering (Python, Ruby), and technical, analytical, and educational writing.

Currently, I work as the technology coordinator for the First Peoples' Cultural Council of British Columbia, organizing and supporting the ongoing development of [FirstVoices](https://www.firstvoices.com/) (a language platform and archive for BC Indigenous communities). In addition to project and user support, I get to apply my skills in data analysis and engineering to customize FPCC's language applications for 90+ unique language varieties!

My linguistic research is in formal morphosyntax and field linguistic research on Indigenous languages of the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia, specializing in Gitksan (GitxsanimxÌ±) and the Tsimshianic languages. My syntactic work focuses on agreement, ergativity, and the features & internal structure of noun phrases. I am involved in ongoing development of text corpora (story collections) and grammatical resources for Gitksan, as well as the design of natural language processing workflows for low-resource languages.
