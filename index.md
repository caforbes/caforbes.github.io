## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am a linguistðŸ’¬ and programmerðŸ’» working in the intersection of natural language analysis, software engineering, and data management.

* [Projects ðŸ§°](/portfolio/tags)
* [Research Papers ðŸ“–](/papers)

My work has been centered around language technology and linguistic analysis for Indigenous language revitalization. Coming from a ten year career in academic research and fieldwork, in more recent times I have been happily involved in software development for web and other platforms, and continue to support communities in their own revitalization work.

I'm currently looking for a new role in language technology, software engineering, or technical writing where I can make the most of my background in linguistics (data diversity, abstraction, information design) and programming (Python, Ruby, SQL, Javascript).
