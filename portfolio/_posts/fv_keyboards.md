- [FirstVoices keyboards](https://keyman.com/keyboards?q=fv_) ([source code](https://github.com/keymanapp/keyboards/tree/master/release/fv)).
    Open-source virtual keyboard software. I designed and contributed to e.g. Dane-Z̲aa Z̲áágéʔ, Háiɫzaqvḷa, and ’Wuìk̓ala, and managed a team of two in a user consultation and improvement project affecting all 90-100 keyboards managed by FPCC.

In my work with First Peoples' Cultural Council, I've designed and maintained a number of keyboards using Keyman software.

- Dane-Zaa (Beaver) keyboard
- Hailzaqvla
- 'Wuik'ala
