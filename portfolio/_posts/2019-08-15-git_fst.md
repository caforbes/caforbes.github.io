An FST-driven annotation tool to analyze and process Gitxsanimx words into their common interlinear annotation format, for Python.

This is a rule-based natural language processing tool that uses finite-state transducers (FSTs) to translate the word into its component morphemes and provide options for an interlinear gloss. It is limited to words found in a central dictionary, but has a very high accuracy rate (>95%). Implemented with Python and the `foma` CLI tool.
