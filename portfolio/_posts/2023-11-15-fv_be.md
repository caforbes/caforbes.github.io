## Contributions

I operated as technical coordinator, data/domain expert, and ad-hoc backend developer for this project. I designed and implemented data models, backend operations for data processing, and internal tools for import, export, and data migration.

I was the owner and lead engineer for the data migration during the transition to this backend. The migration followed a batch ETL process to ingest data from legacy APIs, transform and validate it, and load it into Postgres and AWS S3. Key libraries for this process included pandas, pytest, and django-import-export. Our primary concern was on multi-stage testing to ensure data quality and integrity during the transform steps.
