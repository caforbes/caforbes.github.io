title: FirstVoices Django API backend and data migration
tags: dev pm
---
An open-source, RESTful Django backend built for the FirstVoices web and mobile app frontends.

FirstVoices Web is a content management system (CMS) and language data archive that supports Indigenous community-driven language revitalization. Supporting backend services include Postgres, AWS S3, Elasticsearch.

From an engineering perspective, I operated as an ad-hoc backend developer and data engineer for the launch of this project and as the lead for its initial data migration. My focus was on all things data, including model design, operations for data processing, and import/export features. I was the owner and backend lead for the data migration, which followed a batch ETL process and focused heavily on data transformation, validation, and testing to address legacy integrity issues. Key libraries for this process included pandas, pytest, and django-import-export.

From a design and coordination perspective, I operated as the user liaison and domain expert for the backend and web frontend, designing user-side acceptance criteria for the MVP launch and subsequent features over the next 10 months.
